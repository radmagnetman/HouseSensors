I am building a network of sensors to monitor things in and around my house. Plans are to include several wireless packages to record T and RH in various rooms, a weather station for outside (T, P, RH, wind, and rain), and some status indicators for locks. Dream goals of including power and water consumption.

The sensors will ingest data and send it to a central server for logging. The server is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi.
